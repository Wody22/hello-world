Just another repository

My First step will be to make a team of effective volunteers and share the roles and responsibilities.
1.I will make a list of Colleges nearby my region.
2. I will Print out posters and pamphlets.
3. I will send a team of 4â€“5 Students to other colleges and set up a Help Desk or registration desk and tell them to encourage students for participation.
4. I will tell them to set up a help desk near the college canteen and if any of your friends are studying in the college then take him/her in the campaign.
5. I will Create an Event Facebook / Instagram /Twitter and ask your entire team to share it on their wall and invite all their friends. 
6. I will Create a group of interested students and keep updating them with SMS. 
7. I will Involve Teachers/Faculty, cause Teachers have been known to give out extra credit and course points in exchange for students attending community and campus events.
8. I will make it beneficial to bring friends to the group.
9. I will offer a deal to groups of students.
